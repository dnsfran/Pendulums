Simple and Double Pendulum Simulations
This is a personal project where I implemented simulations of a simple pendulum and a double pendulum. The goal was to put into practice the equations of motion described on the [Wikipedia pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_pendulum) for each system. The codes demonstrate the pendulums’ dynamics, from regular oscillations in the simple pendulum to the chaotic behavior observed in the double pendulum, providing a hands-on approach to classical mechanics.
